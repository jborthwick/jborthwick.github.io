        <h1>Home @ Ten Percent Happier</h1>
        <h2>a case study</h2>

      </hgroup>

      <p>In 2022, Ten Percent Happier wanted to help subscribers find the content they love more quickly, instead of getting lost in its vast library. Furthermore, the existing app structure had slightly stagnated, lacking easy ways to experiment with bringing their unique brand of mindfulness to life.</p>

      <h4>üèÄ Project Background</h4>
      <p>I had been <span class="highlight">Head of Product Design</span> at Ten Percent Happier since 2018 when we started on Home. We had experimented with other centralized "Today" tabs over the years, but while we consistently saw increased engagement <em>(lots of shiny things to explore)</em>, we often saw decreased impact <em>(trial conversion and renewal rates)</em>. This had made us gunshy about crosspolinating the core content modalities (Video Courses, Guided Meditations, Original Podcasts, and Sleep Stories). As our library continued to grow, this static structure was no longer tenable. For this iteration, <span class="highlight">I was determined to ship a central experience that better guided users through our most impactful experiences.</span></p>

      <h4>üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Project Team</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Senior Project Manager</li>
          <li>Lead Product Designer <em>(myself)</em></li>
          <li>Senior Product Designer</li>
          <li>Senior Software Engineer <em>(Frontend)</em></li>
          <li>Senior Software Engineer <em>(Backtend)</em></li>
        </ul>

      <h4>üèÄ High Level Goals</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Create a <span class="highlight">foundational Home experience</span> to test, learn and iterate on.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Guide new users</span> in building a meditation practice.</li>
        <li>Encourage <span class="highlight">depth of engagement</span> through better content merchandising.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Own our DNA</span> with stories that highlight impact, teachers, and community.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>üìà Key Questions & KPIs</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Does the Home experience <span class="highlight">improve trial conversion rates?</span></li>
        <li>Does the Home experience <span class="highlight">positively impact retention?</span></li>
        <li>Does Home improve app <span class="highlight">engagement rates?</span></li>
        <li>What content on Home is <span class="highlight">most appealing?</span></li>
      </ul>

      <h4>üè° What We Built</h4>

      <div class="article-img-large">

        <img src="images/tph_home_structure@2x.jpg">

      </div>

      <p>I advocated for a dual-track experience: the first geared toward new users during their trial period, and a second toward existing subscribers.</p>

      <p><span class="highlight">New meditators would be guided through a 4-week experience highlighting the best performing content.</span> Progression through <em>The Basics</em> would be front and center, as it continually outperformed other courses during a trial period. In qualitative interviews, users often attributed their first <em>"Ah-hah"</em> moment to <em>The Basics</em>, and it highly correlated to activation and trial conversion.</p>

      <div class="article-img-large">

        <img src="images/tph_home_newusers_1@2x.jpg">

      </div>

      <p> Next, users could explore a limited batch of beginner-friendly meditations. While new users were often overwhelmed with the app's large library of meditations, smoke tests had shown surfacing small relevant packs positively impacted M1 > M2 retention.</p>

      <div class="article-img-large">

        <img src="images/tph_home_newusers_2@2x.jpg">

      </div>


      <p>This one-two punch of content would be paired with a series of weekly articles, each packed with insights and content recommendations, modeled after their successful newsletter. And finally, if a user wanted to dig deeper, a selection from their award-winning podcasts could be found.</p>

      <div class="article-img-large">

        <img src="images/tph_home_theweekly@2x.jpg">

      </div>

      <p><span class="highlight">Existing users would have a broader, more personalized experience.</span> If a user was in the middle of a course, their next session would be up front and waiting for them. Easy Access to a user's Favorites and Recently Played, both highly used yet buried features, would also be included.</p>

      <div class="article-img-large series">

        <img src="images/tph_home_existing_1@2x.jpg">
        <img src="images/tph_home_existing_2@2x.jpg">

      </div>

      <p>For users looking for a quick fix, we revamped and added context to a popular meditation of the day feature. For  guidance on tricky topics, we added weekly articles modeled after their succcesful newsletter, bringing fresh insights and content recommendations to the app.</p>

      <div class="article-img-large">

        <img src="images/tph_home_dailydose@2x.jpg">

      </div>

      <p>To keep things fresh, new dynamic meditation packs were added to highlight timely, high-performing meditations. Finally, a latent referall program would be given a much more prominent home.</p>

      </div>

      <h4>üöÄ How We Did</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Trial conversion rate for new users <span class="highlight">increased by 5%.</span></li>
        <li>Day 3 Activation of The Basics <span class="highlight">increased by 12%.</span></li>
        <li>Referall use <span class="highlight">increased by 13%.</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">15% engagement increase </span> with additiaonal content types.</li>
        <li>Updated app structure providng a <span class="highlight">first-class launchpad</span> for future experiments.</li>
        <li>Subscriber <span class="highlight">renewal rates maintained.</span></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Overall a success. While renewal rates remained neutral, we increased trial conversion, added much needed guidance for new users, introduced an array of new content merchandising, and shipped a refreshed UI all without rocking the boat for existing users.</p>

      <p>Plus, the new home experience created a great foundation for Ten Percent Happier to experiment from going forward.</p>

      <p>Initial multivariate tests were launched in the fall of 2022 to observe impact and mitigate risk. In mid-December, the new Home experience fully rolled out, just in time for Ten Percent Happier's biggest launch of the year: The Dalai Lama's Guide to Happiness.</p>

      <h4>üöÄ What Didn't Make the Cut?</h4>

      <p>I originally pushed to also experiment with <span class="highlight">a new content format designed specfically for Home</span class="highlight">. What if we created a new daily "story" that combined a potent combo of perspectives + practices from TPH, presented in a format that's:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>serendipitous, i.e. piques curiosity with a new topic daily</li>
        <li>approachable, i.e. missing yesterday's won't leave you behind</li>
        <li>educational, i.e. you'll learn something new every day</li>
        <li>inspirational, i.e. encourages further learning about topics</li>
        <li>communal, i.e. it's the same for everyone</li>
        <li>clocks in around ~10 minutes or less</li>
        <li>We've temporarily nicknamed this idea The Daily.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We built a hasty, yet well-received, prototype for The Daily, but the experiment was tabled due to manage the initial scope of Home.<p>
