        <h1>Home @ Ten Percent Happier</a></h1>
        <h2>a case study</h2>

      </hgroup>

      <p>Home was a project designed to quickly and easily connect people with content they love, and bring the app to life through storytelling and timely recommendations. <span class="highlight">I was the lead product designer</span> and the project required close cross-functional collaboration between product, engineering, and content teams.</p>

      <span id="subnav"><a href="#problem">Probelm</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="#context">Context</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="#goals">Goals & KPIs</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="#team">Designs</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="#team">Results</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="#cut">B-sides</a></span>

      <h4 id="problem">üôà Customer Problems </h4>

      <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Little guidance for new users</span> who were left to wander an incresasingly overhwelming amount of content.</li>
        <li>Over half of new users <span class="highlight">skipped the highest performing intro course</span>, leaving them on their own to get a practice started.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Content felt stagnant,</span> providing little motivation for existing users to return daily.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="context">üîÆ Project Context</h4>
      <p>When we started Home, I had 4 years of context at Ten Percent Happier as their Head of Product Design. We had experimented with centralized "Today" tabs over the years, but while we consistently saw increased engagement <em>(lots of shiny things to explore)</em>, we also saw decreased impact <em>(trial conversion and renewal rates)</em>. For this iteration, <span class="highlight">I wanted to ship a dynamic experience that better guided users through our most impactful content.</span></p>

      <!-- <h4 id="team">üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Project Team</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Senior Project Manager</li>
          <li><span class="highlight">Lead Product Designer <em>(myself)</em></span></li>
          <li>Senior Software Engineer</li>
          <li>Senior Backend Engineer</li>
        </ul> -->

      <h4 id="goals">üèÄ High Level Goals</h4>

      <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Guide new users</span> in building a meditation practice.</li>
        <li>Encourage <span class="highlight">depth of engagement</span> through better content merchandising.</li>
        <li>Create a <span class="highlight">foundational Home experience</span> to test, learn and iterate on.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="kpis">üìà Key Questions & KPIs</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Does the Home experience <span class="highlight">improve trial conversion rates?</span></li>
        <li>Does the Home experience <span class="highlight">positively impact retention?</span></li>
        <li>Does Home improve app <span class="highlight">engagement rates?</span></li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="built">üè° What We Did</h4>

      <div class="article-img-large series">

        <img src="images/tph_home_sketches@2x.jpg">
        <!-- <img src="images/tph_home_structure@2x.jpg"> -->

      </div>

      <p>I sketched out an array of solutions, collaborating closely with stakeholders from product, engineering, and content teams. We landed on a dual-track experience: the first geared toward new users during their trial period, and a second toward existing subscribers.</p>

      <p><span class="highlight">New users would be guided through a 4-week experience highlighting the best performing content.</span> Progression through <em>The Basics</em> would be front and center, as it continually outperformed other courses during a user's trial period. In qualitative interviews, users often attributed their first <em>"Ah-hah"</em> moment to <em>The Basics</em>, and it highly correlated to activation and trial conversion.</p>

      <p>New users could also explore a limited batch of beginner-friendly meditations. While new users were often overwhelmed with the app's large library of meditations, smoke tests had shown surfacing small relevant packs positively impacted M1 > M2 retention. </p>

        <img src="images/tph_home_newusers_2@2x.jpg">

      </div>

      <p>This one-two punch of content would be paired with a special 4-week series of articles, The Weekly Focus, packed with helpful content recommendations focused on starting a meditation habit, modeled after Ten Percent Happier's successful newsletter.</p>

      <div class="article-img-large">

        <img src="images/tph_home_theweekly@2x.jpg">

      </div>

      <p><span class="highlight">Existing users would have a broader, more personalized experience.</span> If a user was in the middle of a course, their next session would be up front and waiting for them. Easy Access to a user's Favorites and Recently Played, both highly used yet buried features, would also be included.</p>

      <p>And for a quick fix, we revamped and added context to our popular meditation of the day feature, The Daily Dose. For new areas to explore, The Weekly Focus would dive into more diverse topics, bringing fresh insights and content suggestions to the app each week.</p>

      <p>Finally, to keep things fresh throughout the day, new dynamic meditation packs were added to highlight timely, high-performing meditations.</p>

        <img src="images/tph_home_rightnow@2x.jpg">

      </div>

      <h4 id="results">üöÄ How We Did</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Trial conversion rate for new users <span class="highlight">increased by 5%.</span></li>
        <li>Day 3 Activation of The Basics <span class="highlight">increased by 12%.</span></li>
        <li>Referall use <span class="highlight">increased by 13%.</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">15% engagement increase </span> with additiaonal content types.</li>
        <li>Updated app structure providng a <span class="highlight">first-class launchpad</span> for future experiments.</li>
        <li>Subscriber <span class="highlight">renewal rates maintained.</span></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Overall a success. While renewal rates remained neutral, we increased trial conversion, added much needed guidance for new users, introduced an array of new content merchandising, and shipped a refreshed UI all without rocking the boat for existing users.</p>

      <p>Plus, the new home experience created a great foundation for Ten Percent Happier to experiment from going forward.</p>

      <p>Initial multivariate tests were launched in the fall of 2022 to observe impact and mitigate risk. In mid-December, the new Home experience fully rolled out, just in time for Ten Percent Happier's biggest launch of the year: The Dalai Lama's Guide to Happiness.</p>

      <h4 id="cut">‚úÇÔ∏è What Didn't Make the Cut?</h4>

      <p>I originally pushed to experiment with <span class="highlight">a new format, nicknamed The Daily, designed specfically for Home</span>: a daily story that combined a potent combo of perspectives + practices from TPH that felt:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><em>serendipitous</em>, i.e. piques curiosity with a new topic daily</li>
        <li><em>approachable</em>, i.e. missing yesterday's won't leave you behind</li>
        <li><em>educational</em>, i.e. you'll learn something new every day</li>
        <li><em>communal</em>, i.e. a shared space to passively connect with community</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We built a few hasty, well-received, prototypes for The Daily, but the experiment was tabled to manage scope. However, the seeds of The Daily continue to take root in new projects at Ten Percent Happier.<p>
