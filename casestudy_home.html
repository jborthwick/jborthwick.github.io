        <h1>Ten Percent Happier</h1>
        <h2>a case study</h2>

      </hgroup>

      <p>I had the privilege of leading product design at <span class="highlight">Ten Percent Happier</span> between 2017 and 2023, collaborating closely with product, engineering and content teams to ship impact-driven, human-centered designs.</p>

      <p>In 2022, Ten Percent Happier wanted to help subscribers find the content they love more quickly, instead of getting lost in its vast library. Furthermore, the existing app structure had stagnated, lacking easy ways to experiment with bringing their unique brand of mindfulness to life.</p>

      <h4>üèÄ High Level Goals</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Create a <span class="highlight">foundational Home experience</span> to test, learn and iterate on.</li>
        <li>Encourage <span class="highlight">depth of engagement</span> through a broader array of content.</li>
        <li>Better <span class="highlight">guide brand new members</span> into starting a meditation practice with Ten Percent Happier.</li>
        <!-- <li>Drive <span class="highlight">increased engagement</span> by providing compelling reasons to visit the app more often with lively, changing content recommendations.</li> -->
        <li><span class="highlight">Showcase our difference</span> with stories that highlights our impact, teachers, and community.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>üìä Key Questions & KPIs</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Does the Home experience <span class="highlight">improve trial conversion rates?</span></li>
        <li>Does the Home experience <span class="highlight">positively impact retention?</span></li>
        <li>Does Home improve app <span class="highlight">engagement rates?</span></li>
        <li>What content on Home is <span class="highlight">most appealing?</span></li>
      </ul>

      <h4>üè° What We Built</h4>

      <p>We landed on a dual-track experience: the first geared toward new users during their trial period, and a second toward existing subscribers.</p>

      <div class="article-img-large">

        <img src="images/tph_home_newusers_1@2x.jpg">

      </div>

      <p><span class="highlight">New meditators would be guided through a 4-week experience highlighting the best performing content.</span> Progression through <em>The Basics</em> would be front and center, as it continually outperformed other courses during a user's trial period. In qualitative interviews, user's often attributed their first <em>"Ah-hah"</em> moment to <em>The Basics</em>, and it highly correlated to activation and trial conversion.</p>

      <div class="article-img-large">

        <img src="images/tph_home_newusers_2@2x.jpg">

      </div>

      <p> Next, users could explore a limited batch of beginner-friendly meditations. While new users were often overwhelmed with the app's large library of meditations, smoke tests had shown surfacing small relevant packs positively impacted M1 > M2 retention.</p>

      <p>This one-two punch of content would be paired with a series of weekly articles, each packed with insights and content recommendations, modeled after their successful newsletter. And finally, if a user wanted to dig deeper, a selection from their award-winning podcasts could be found.</p>

        <img src="images/tph_home_existing_1@2x.jpg">
        <img src="images/tph_home_existing_2@2x.jpg">

      </div>

      <p><span class="highlight">Existing users would have a broader, more personalized experience.</span> If a user was in the middle of a course, their next session would be up front and waiting for them. Easy Access to a user's Favorites and Recently Played, both highly used yet buried features, would also be included.</p>

      <div class="article-img-large">

        <img src="images/tph_home_dailydose@2x.jpg">

      </div>

      <p>For users looking for a quick fix, we revamped and added context to a popular meditation of the day feature. For added guidance on tricky topics, we added weekly articles modeled after their succcesful newsletter, bringing fresh insights and content recommendations to the app. To keep things fresh, new dynamic meditation packs were added to highlight timely, high-performing meditations. Finally, a latent referall program would be given a much more prominent home.</p>

      <div class="article-img-large">

        <img src="images/tph_home_rightnow@2x.jpg">

      </div>

      <p>Most importantly, <span class="highlight">a new foundation to iterate from would be built,</span> a key strategic initiative as Ten Percent Happier steered out of the choppy post-pandemic waters.</p>

      <h4>üå± How We Did</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Trial conversion rate for new users <span class="highlight">increased by 5%.</span></li>
        <li>Day 3 Activation of The Basics <span class="highlight">increased by 12%.</span></li>
        <li>Referall use <span class="highlight">increased by 13%.</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">15% engagement increase </span> with additiaonal content types.</li>
        <li>Subscriber <span class="highlight">renewal rates maintained.</span></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Overall a success. We increased trial conversion, added much needed guidance for new users, introduced an array of new content, and shifted to a new modern UI all without rocking the boat for existing users. And the new home experience created a foundation for Ten Percent Happier to experiment from.</p>

      <p>Initial multivariate tests were launched in the fall of 2022 to observe impact and mitigate risk. In mid-December, the new Home experience fully rolled out, just in time for Ten Percent Happier's biggest launch of the year: The Dalai Lama's Guide to Happiness.</p>
