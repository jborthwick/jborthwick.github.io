        <h1>Pixels <em>&amp;</em> Pancakes</h1>
        <h2>portfolio of ui, ux and other fine acronyms</h2>
        <h5>by JEREMY BORTHWICK</h5>

      </hgroup>

      <p>I’m a designer by trade and a builder at heart. I love to figure out what makes something tick, so I can make it work better. I grew up in the swamps of Florida before escaping to the blizzards of Boston, where I lead projects for national brands like <span class="highlight">Fidelity, MINI, Harvard, and Saucony,</span> along with local nonprofits like the Greater Boston Food Bank and Franciscan Children’s Hospital. And on Saturday’s I make delicious pancakes for my son and daughter.</p>

      <p><span class="highlight">Now I lead product design at Mapkin,</span> where we’re building the first friendly GPS. Along with crafting all UI &amp; UX design, I help write the rules engine that drives the voice navigation.</p>

      <h3 id="mapkin">Mapkin</h3>

      <p>What if a GPS guided you like a friend? Riding shotgun, they'd say "Take a right at the light, just past the library", not "Turn right right in 750 feet". That's Mapkin.</p>

      <div class="article-img-large">

        <img src="images/mapkin_2up_1.jpg">

      </div>

      <p>With an incredibly small team, we built a nation-wide GPS app with intuitive turn-by-turn directions based on analyzing OSM map data, on-the-ground seeding efforts and tips from Mapkin users. We incorporated visual landmarks, local tips, lane guidance, warnings about tricky intersections, friendly reminders, and more.</p>

      <div class="article-img-large">

      </div>

      <p>On top of that, we gave it an incredibly simple interface, designed to get you going fast while safe and easy to use on the road.</p>

      <div class="article-img-large">

      <p>At launch, Mapkin was <span class="highlight">immediately featured by Apple</span>. Within 6 months, <span class="highlight">drivers had passed over 2 million miles.</span></p>

      <p>The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'I am older than you, and must know better'; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.</p>

      <h3 id="harvard">Harvard Magazine</h3>

      <p>Harvard Magazine was hunting for a web app with a print vibe. I led wireframing, prototyping, user-testing, and design with a focus on making readers happy. The digital edition includes crisp layouts, personal read-later lists, robust offline support and a recommendation engine, all while ensuring casual readers could just lay back and leisurely flip through an issue.</p>

      <p>At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, 'Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'll soon make you dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.</p>

      <h3 id="mini">MINI</h3>

      <p>For their flagship Manhattan store, MINI wanted to provide a personal, hassle-free way to shop. I led the UX for an iPad app that allowed shoppers to explore MINI's rich history, browse model features and, most importantly, configure their ideal MINI, all without having to talk to a dealer. I also oversaw the custom crafting of matching, super thin, anondized alumninum cases.</p>

      <h3 id="csmonitor">CS MONITOR</h3>

      <p>One of the most highly respected and misunderstood news agencies around, the Monitor offers award-winning, secular, news coverage and their aging site was doing them a huge disservice. While a responsive build wasn't possible for this interim refresh, the Monitor sought a modern design which showcased their coverage's fantastic depth and global reach. I led reader testing and design and the refresh is now being built by the Monitor.</p>

      <h3 id="franciscan">FRANCISCAN</h3>

      <p>Franciscan deserved a site that showcased their dedication, passion and unrivaled breadth in serving the physical, mental and educational needs of a diverse community of kids. Weaving rich photography with real, compelling success stories, and a more inviting brand refresh, I led UX and design for a new franciscanhospital.org.</p>

      <h3 id="saucony">SAUCONY</h3>

      <p>Saucony wanted to prove their commitment to people's long-term health, thus RUN4GOOD was born, allowing runners to fight childhood obsesity with every mile under foot. I led concepting, wireframing, prototyping, and design of a unique, full-featured, running app that combines personal milestones with collaborative mileage goals that trigger corporate donations. Runners clocked in over 300,000 miles, helping raise over $300,000 for charity.</p>

      <h3 id="killscreen">KILL SCREEN</h3>

      <p>Dedicated to the news & art of games & play, Kill Screen wanted to break from the rowdy, male-centric design of most game sites of the time. I led the design of Killscreendaily.com over the last two years, catering to their evolving, yet always level-headed and feature-driven editorial voice. I also hand-crafted eBooks of their quarterly print journal, maintaining as much of the rich design as possible while supporting the wide range of ePub &amp; MOBI readers.</p>
