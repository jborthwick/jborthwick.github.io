        <h1>Pixels <em>&amp;</em> Pancakes</h1>
        <h2>portfolio of ui, ux and other fine acronyms</h2>
        <h5>by JEREMY BORTHWICK</h5>

      </hgroup>

      <p>I’m a designer by trade and a builder at heart. I grew up in the swamps of Florida before escaping to the blizzards of Boston, where I lead projects for national brands like <span class="highlight">Fidelity, MINI, Harvard, and Saucony,</span> along with fantastic local nonprofits like Franciscan Children’s Hospital. And on Saturday’s I make delicious pancakes for my son and daughter.</p>

      <p><span class="highlight">Now I lead product design at Mapkin,</span> where we’re building the first friendly GPS. Along with crafting strategy and UI &amp; UX design, I help write the rules engine that drives Mapkin's turn-by-turn voice narration.</p>

      <h3 id="mapkin">Mapkin</h3>

      <p>What if a GPS guided you like a friend? Riding shotgun, they'd say <em>"Take a right at the light, just past the library"</em>, not <em>"Turn right right in 750 feet".</em> That's Mapkin.</p>

      <p>At launch, Mapkin was <span class="highlight">immediately featured by Apple</span>. Within months, <span class="highlight">drivers had clocked well over 2 million miles.</span></p>

      <p>In May 2016, <span class="highlight">Mapkin was acquired by MapQuest</span>, where we're now leading new initiatives.

      <div class="article-img-large">

        <img src="images/mapkin_2up_1.jpg">

      </div>

      <p>With an incredibly small team, we built a <span class="highlight">nation-wide GPS app</span> with intuitive turn-by-turn directions based on analyzing OSM map data, on-the-ground seeding efforts and tips from Mapkin users. Not a small effort by any means. We incorporated visual landmarks, local tips, lane guidance, warnings about tricky intersections, friendly reminders, and more.</p>

      <div class="article-img-large">

        <img src="images/Mapkin-in-Car.jpg">

      </div>

      <p>On top of that, we gave it an incredibly simple interface, designed to get you going fast while always remaining <span class="highlight">safe and easy to use on the road.</span></p>

      <div class="article-img-large">

        <img src="images/mapkin_2up_route_settings_1.jpg">

      </div>

      <p>Since the focus of Mapkin was voice guidance, an initial priority was to create a <span class="highlight">rules engine that was powerful enough to always give the best direction given all the available facts.</span> However, we also wanted to keep things <span class="highlight">simple and flexible enough that product design could lead the effort</span> instead of engineering. Thus, KITTscript was born, a concotion of python wrapped in YAML that leveraged data from a variety of sources to create personalized narration for every route.</p>

      <div class="article-img-large">

        <img src="images/mapkin_kittscript.png">

      </div>

      <p>Anothe big effort was creating a simple way for users to share local tips with other drivers. We designed <span class="highlight">an eyes-free method of sending voice notes.</span> While navigating, a driver could press and hold anywhere on the screen and start speaking, release and the recording would be sent. Afterward, our team would add the tip to our custom data layer and KITTScript would weave the info into voice guidance for everyone.</p>

      <h3 id="harvard">Harvard Magazine</h3>

      <p>Harvard Magazine was hunting for a web app with a print vibe. I led wireframing, prototyping, user-testing, and design with a focus on making readers happy.</p>

      <div class="article-img-large">

        <img src="images/harvard_1up_1.jpg">

      </div>

      <p>The digital edition includes crisp layouts, personal read-later lists, robust offline support and a recommendation engine, all while ensuring casual readers could just lay back and leisurely flip through an issue.</p>

      <h3 id="mini">MINI</h3>

      <p>For their flagship Manhattan store, MINI wanted to provide a personal, hassle-free way to shop. I led the UX for an iPad app that allowed shoppers to explore MINI's rich history, browse model features and, most importantly, configure their ideal MINI, all without having to talk to a dealer.</p>

      <div class="article-img-large">

        <img src="images/mini_inhand_1.jpg">

      </div>

      <p>I also oversaw the custom crafting of matching, super-thin, anondized alumninum cases.</p>

      <h3 id="csmonitor">CS MONITOR</h3>

      <p>One of the most highly respected and misunderstood news agencies around, the Monitor offers award-winning, secular, news coverage and their aging site was doing them a huge disservice. While a responsive design wasn't possible given project constraints, the Monitor sought a modern design which showcased their coverage's fantastic depth and global reach.</p>

      <div class="article-img-large long">

        <img src="images/csm_article_1.jpg">

      </div>

      <p>I led reader testing and design and the refresh is now being built by the Monitor.</p>

      <h3 id="franciscan">FRANCISCAN</h3>

      <p>Franciscan deserved a site that showcased their dedication, passion and unrivaled breadth in serving the physical, mental and educational needs of a diverse community of kids. I led UX and design for a new site weaving together rich photography with real, compelling success stories, and a more inviting brand refresh.</p>

      <h3 id="saucony">SAUCONY</h3>

      <p>Saucony wanted to prove their commitment to people's long-term health, thus RUN4GOOD was born, allowing runners to fight childhood obsesity with every mile under foot.</p>

      <div class="article-img-large">

        <img src="images/r4g_portfolio_inhand_1.jpg">

      </div>

      <p>I devised the original concept and led wireframing, prototyping, and design of a unique, full-featured, running app that combines personal milestones with collaborative mileage goals that trigger corporate donations.</p>

      <div class="article-img-large">

        <img src="images/r4g_3up_1.jpg">

      </div>

      <p>After launch, runners clocked in <span class="highlight">over 300,000 miles, helping raise over $300,000 for charity.</span></p>

      <h3 id="killscreen">KILL SCREEN</h3>

      <p>Dedicated to the news & art of games & play, Kill Screen wanted to break from the rowdy, male-centric design of most game sites of the time. I led the design of Killscreendaily.com over the last two years, catering to their evolving, feature-driven editorial voice.</p>

      <div class="article-img-large">

        <img src="images/ks_ebooks_3.jpg">

      </div>

      <p>I also hand-crafted eBooks of their quarterly print journal, maintaining as much of the rich design as possible while supporting a wide range of ePub &amp; MOBI readers.</p>

      <p>At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, 'Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'll soon make you dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.</p>
